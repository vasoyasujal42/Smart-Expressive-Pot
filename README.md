## Basic information related to project
- Normally we are seeing ordinary plants in over homes and they also do not communicate with us. 
- When we see the plant, it looks so simple and so boring, and also not attractive therefore we do not take care of our plant. 
- People don't know about the perfect requirement for plants in terms of water, sunlight, and compost.
- What if the plant looks very attractive and expressive by using smart monitoring and thorough animation and expression. There we come up with our product “Smart Expressive Pot

### Description for problem
- In the journal when we put the plant in our home we do not completely take care of the plant.
- Sometimes plants cannot get a sufficient amount of sunlight which is the main reason plants die.
- To grow the Plant generally it needs a sufficient amount of moisture in the soil, temperature, and fresh environment.
- Due to the busy schedules of humans and also plant not attractive they do not take care of plants.
- Plants face difficulty in growing and it's stuck on nutrition problems.


### Objective / Aim of project
- Our main objective is to take care of plants and also to be attentive. That's why people pay attention to the plant.
- For those problems we will use the embedded system with IoT.
- To take care of the plant we measure the parameters and analyze them upon which we give the low level or high level of the parameter indication and also we give the notification to the owner via the application.
- Our embedded system takes the data from the sensor and gives it to the database and from that, we can see those things on the desktop, laptop, and phone.
- Form that people can understand the condition of the plant like plant fills the thirsty, hot, cold, over soil moisture condition.
- For the attention problem we put one emoji display on a plant from that people can interact with the plant from that also people can also understand its condition of the plant.
- Via emoji expression humans can understand what thing was needed by the plant like water, and sunlight. 
- Like for the thirsty condition we put emojis if all parameters are fine then the display shows the happy emoji.

### Value Proposition of the project

- Our product take care the plant as well as reduce the human efforts. 
- Today we can observe that peoples feel very alone they dont have person or thing to spend their time. So our plant spend time with them as a intelligent toy.
- Form our animated display people can also entertainment with them selves.  
- While we have a plant in our house that plant beneficial for our healh and it also create a positive climate with positive energy.

### Future Proposition of the project

- Currently we are on the process of making our product then after we making our own website and own app.
- Than after we are doing digital marketing for our product at a large scale.
- In future we are making different kind of pots currently we are making regular size of pots like we are adding different kind of functions like rechargeable battery system,wire less power charging method,in built google/alexa like system,gesture control.
- We want to make our own manufacturer plant as well as manpower and office to develop our product on a large scale.
